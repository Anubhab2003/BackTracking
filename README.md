# BackTracking
Certainly! Backtracking in Java is a technique used for solving problems by trying out different possibilities and undoing them if they don't lead to a solution. It's often used in recursive algorithms where choices are made and backtracked if they fail. This method is helpful in solving problems like Sudoku, N-Queens, and maze solving. It efficiently explores all possible paths to find a solution.
